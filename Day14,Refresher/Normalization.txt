Normalizations:is a database technique that reduce data redundancy and eliminates undesirable charactersitic like insertion, update, and delete anomalies.
Or, it is the process ot organizing data in database.
Or, Database normalization is a databsae design principle for organizing data in an organized and consistent way.

.it helps you avoid redundancy and maintain the integrity of the database. it also helps you eliminate undesirable characteristics associated with insertion, deletion, and updating.

Purpose of Normalization: The main purpose of database normalization is to avoid complexities, eliminate duplicate, and organized data in consistent way.

Primary Key: A PK is a single column values used to identify a database record uniquely.

Foreign Key:FK is a key that relates to the primary key in another table.

Composite Key A CK is just like a Primary key, but instead ot having a column, it has multiple columns.

What 1NF 2NF and 3NF?

1NF:
.Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.
.Create a separate table for each set of related data.
.There mus be a primary key for identification.

2NF:The 1NF only eliminates repeating groups, not redundancy. that's why there is 2NF.
.Relates these tables with foreign key.
.create separate table for set of values that apply to multiple record.

3NF:When a table is in 2NF, it eliminates repeating groups and redundancy, but it does not eliminate transivie partial dependency.
.Have no transitive partial dependency.
