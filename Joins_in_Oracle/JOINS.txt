 Types of Joins:
equi join (inner join)
outer join
   left outer join
   right outer join
   full outer join
non equi join
self join
natural join.



Day5:
Inner join: 
whenever when you want to get data from two table you need join.
inner join or equie join retrivin data from the multiple/two table based on
equality conditon which means it is used just ( = ).

E.G:this example will show all the record from both table based on inner join clause.
select c.c_name,c.c_lname,o.o_name from customer c
  2  inner join orders o
  3  on c.c_id = o.c_id;

---------------------
E.G: This example will show the record by the name of whatever user write.
select c.c_name,c.c_lname,o.o_name from customer c
  2  inner join orders o
  3  on c.c_id = o.c_id
  4  where c.c_name = 'Ahmad'; 
-----------------------------------

E.G: This example will show the record that ordered Iphone?
select c.c_name,o.o_name from customer c
  2  inner join orders o
  3  on c.c_id = o.c_id
  4  where o.o_name = 'Iphone';
--------------------------

E.G:This example same as above example.
select c.c_name,o.o_name from customer c, orders o
where c.c_id = o.c_id and c.c_name = 'Nadir';




non-equi join:Retriving data from multiple/two table based on
not equality condition which means it is used any condition except ( = ).
OPT which gets used ( <, >, <=, >=, !<, !>, !=, betweem , and),



Natural join: column with the same name in source and target table are automatically assosciated with each other.
which means each columns from source table and target tableare associated with each other if the columns has the same name.

Source Table:Table which comes after FROM clause in the SELECT statement.
Target Table: All the table which come after JOIN clause in the query.

When the join query is executed then oracle starts matching data from the source table to the target table.
if there is a hit for a matching source table data in the target table then the values is returned
ex: select empno,ename,dname,loc from emp natural join dept;
               src table                                trgt table
---------------------------------------------------------
left-Outer-Join:table mentioned first after on will have shown all record .
table mentioned second will have matched data ora nulls.

e.g: select f.f_id,f.f_name,f.uni_id,u.uni_id,u.uni_name 
from faculty f left join uni u
on f.uni_id = u.uni_id; it shows all from tbl1 by matching tbl1, if if the two table has null, the query will have shown this.
----------------------------------------------------------------

E.G: This Example first,will show all the record and second table will match the data.
select c.c_name,p.p_id from citizen c
left outer join passport p 
on c.c_id = p.c_id;
------------------------------------------------------------------

Right-Outer join: table mentioned first will matching the data or null,
and table second mentioned will shown all the record.

E.G:This Example match the first table record or will have shown nul select c.c_name,p.p_id from citizen c
right outer join passport p
on c.c_id = p.c_id;

Full-Outer-join: will show all the record from left and right table.
E.G:
select c.c_name,p.p_id from citizen c full outer join passport p
on c.c_id = p.c_id;
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Self-Join:Joining a table-data by iteself is called self-join.
.Can use with alias name of the table.
.Can be implemented only on single-table.
.When we compare a column values within the same table.

E.G:How to find the same salary in the same table by ename.
select * from emp e1,emp e2 where e1.sal = e2.sal and e2.sal = 2300;
Or:
select e1.empno,e1.ename,e1.sal from emp e1,emp e2 where e1.sal = e2.sal
and e2.ename = 'nasir';
------------------------------------------------------------
E.G:How to find the same job into the same table.
select e1.empno,e1.ename,e1.job,e1.sal from emp e1,emp e2
 where e1.job = e2.job and e2.job = 'SALESMAN';
       'join condition'     'addition condition' 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Cross/Cartesian-Join:Every record in one table is joined to every record in another table is called Cartesian-Join.
E.X:Table A has 20 records
    Table B has 50 records
C-J will show 1000 result (20*50).

E.G: Select empno,ename,sal,job,dname from emp cross join dept;
     Select empno,ename,sal,job,dname from emp,dept;
-----------------
E.G: select ename,job,sal,dname from emp,dept where dname = 'SALES';
