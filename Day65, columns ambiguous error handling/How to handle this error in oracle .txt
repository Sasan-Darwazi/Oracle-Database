How to handle this error in oracle database? = column ambiguously defined? 


SQL> select dname,deptno,sum(sal) from emp inner join dept
  2  on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
  3  group by dname,deptno;
group by dname,deptno
               *
ERROR at line 3:
ORA-00918: column ambiguously defined

Note: Here, Oracle SQL Engine will get confused or baffled because it does not recognize which table's "name", column should be selected, which throws columns ambiguosuly defined.
In next I am going to provide the precise query how to handle or refrain ambigous columns.

This types of errors mostly happen in joins connectins.

E.G:
SQL> select dept.dname,emp.deptno,sum(sal) from emp inner join dept
  2  on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
  3  group by dept.dname,emp.deptno;

DNAME              DEPTNO   SUM(SAL)
