Transaction: Transaction access data using read write operations.
Or, a database transaction is a sequence of muitiple operations performed on a database, and all the operation served a single logical unit.
In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the trancsaction, acid properties are followed.
ACID:
Automactiy, Consistency, Isolation,Durability.


Or ACID: that helps and making sure the single unit of work would be executed in dependable manner.

Automicity: that database is able to perform the transcation in an atomic manner.

Consistency: the database should help in achieviang the correct data state.
E.G: with adding constraint we can perform the consistency, such as adding constraint on the ID field, in order to do not add the same value.

Isolation: concurrent control and how the database perform the request when the request is wrong.

E.G:there is account by having 1000$
A account  want to get 100 $.
B account wants to get 1000$.

This action will not be taken place, so long as, the database does not allow the action to be performed, which is why the isolation called concurrent control.

it means, if the A account launch for the first time, the amount due will be 900 $ and there is no adequate money for the second account.

Durabilty: just means once the transaction has been committed the data must be written to non-volatine memory or the storage.
even if the crush happens or something wrong happens with the database, the database must be there and no be corrupted.
