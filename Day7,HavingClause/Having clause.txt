
HAVING: select lasname,count(*) from emp
where count(*)>1 group by lastname;
.SQl doesnt allow that, cuz where cluase is used before the group by and the count(*).
we have another function for that, HAVING.

Having: filter record after the group by, and Having goes after the group by stmt.


select empno,ename,count(*) from emp
group by empno,ename
having count(*) > 0;
or having count(*) = 1;
