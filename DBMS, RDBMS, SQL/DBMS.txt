DBMS: Database Management Systems are software management systems that store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.


The Most widely used types of DBMS software are relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network.


Distributed database management system.
A distributed DBMS is a set of logically interrelated or interconnected databases distributed over a network that is managed by a centralized database application. This type of DBMS synchronizes data periodically and ensures that any change to data is universally updated in the database.


Hierarchical database management system
Hierarchical databases organize model data in a tree-like structure. Data storage is either a top-down or bottom-up format and is represented using a parent-child relationship.


Network database management system.

The network database model addresses the need for more complex relationships by allowing each child to have multiple parents. 


Object-oriented database management system.

Object-oriented models store data in objects instead of rows and columns. It is based on object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to have members such as fields, properties, and models.
