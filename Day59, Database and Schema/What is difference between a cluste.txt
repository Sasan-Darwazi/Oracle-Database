What is difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?

A Clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. it changes the way the data is stored on disk and can be created on only one column.
A table can have only one clustered index.

A non-clustered index does not affext the physial order of data in a table. it is sotred separately and contains a pointer to the actual data.
A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.
