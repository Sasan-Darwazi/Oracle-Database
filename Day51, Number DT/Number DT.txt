BIT(size) A bit-value type with a default of 1. The allowed number of bits in a 
value is set via the size parameter, which can hold values from 1 to 64.


TINYINT(size)
A very small integer with a signed range of -128 to 127, and an 
unsigned range of 0 to 255. Here, the size parameter specifies the 
maximum allowed display width, which is 255.



BOOL Essentially a quick way of setting the column to TINYINT with a size of 
1. 0 is considered false, whilst 1 is considered true.


BOOLEAN Same as BOOL.



SMALLINT(size)
A small integer with a signed range of -32768 to 32767, and an 
unsigned range from 0 to 65535. Here, the size parameter specifies 
the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.




Data Type Description
MEDIUMINT(size)
A medium integer with a signed range of -8388608 to 8388607, 
and an unsigned range from 0 to 16777215. Here, the size parameter 
specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 255.



INT(size)
A medium integer with a signed range of -2147483648 to 
2147483647, and an unsigned range from 0 to 4294967295. Here, the 
size parameter specifies the maximum allowed display width, which is 
255.



INTEGER(size) Same as INT.
BIGINT(size)
A medium integer with a signed range of -9223372036854775808 
to 9223372036854775807, and an unsigned range from 0 to 
18446744073709551615. Here, the size parameter specifies the 
maximum allowed display width, which is 255.



FLOAT(p)
A floating point number value. If the precision (p) parameter is between 
0 to 24, then the data type is set to FLOAT(), whilst if its from 25 to 53, 
the data type is set to DOUBLE(). This behaviour is to make the storage 
of values more efficient.
DOUBLE(size, d)
A floating point number value where the total digits are set by the size 
parameter, and the number of digits after the decimal point is set by 
the d parameter.



DECIMAL(size, d)
An exact fixed point number where the total number of digits is set by 
the size parameters, and the total number of digits after the decimal 
point is set by the d parameter.
For size, the maximum number is 65 and the default is 10, whilst for d, 
the maximum number is 30 and the default is 10.




DEC(size, d) Same as DECIMAL.
