Group BY:we can used the group rows bases on one or more column or expression: like we can group the record based on deptno,job,ename or year of joining.

what the group by is doing?
detail the data,
the detail is taken from the table.
while the detail taken, the result called, summarize the data.
and summarize the data use for analysis, cuz the detail got summarized then, summarized data easy for analysis.

The purpose of G/P is grouping the data.


E.G: if you want to show the sum(sal) based on deptno?
select deptno,sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;


E.G:It will shows sum(sal) based on dname?
select dname,sum(sal) from dept inner join emp
  2  on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
  3  group by dname;


E.G:It shows the record sum(sal) based on dname only two dept?
 select dname,sum(sal) from dept
  2  inner join emp
  3  on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
  4  where dname IN('ACCOUNTING','SALES')
  5  group by dname;



E.G: if you want to show how many emp is working in which table?
select job,count(*) from emp
group by job
order by job asc;


E.G:it shows the job-name group by job;
select job from emp
group by job;


E.G:it shows the who get the same salary group by sal.
select sal,count(*) from emp gorup b

E.G: if you want to show which emp joined in which year?
by to_char Funtion.

select to_char(hiredate,'yyyy') as year,count(*)
from emp
group by to_char(hiredate,'yyyy');

To-Char: Converts a number or date to a string value.
.Return varchar2 data type.
.Accepts many different number or date data types.

Syntax: to_char(input_value,[format_mask]);

E.G: select to_char(12345.68,'99999.9') from dual;

E.G: select to_char(12345,'000000000') from dual;

E.G: select to_char(sysdate,'yyyy-MM-DD') from dual;

E.G: select to_char(sysdate,'Month') from dual;


E.G: if you want to show the ename,job as group?
select ename,job,count(*) from emp
group by ename,job
order by ename,job asc;



E.G: if you want to show, deptno and sum(sal) where deptno in(10,20)?
select deptno,sum(sal) from emp
where deptno IN(10,20)
group by deptno
order by 1 asc;


E.G: if you want to show department name and sum(sal)?
select dept.dname,sum(sal) from emp
inner join dept
on dept.deptno = emp.deptno
group by dname
order by 1 asc;
----------------------------

E.G: If you want to show dname that its sum(sal) is bigger next to 13000.
select dname,sum(sal) from emp inner join dept
on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
group by dname
having sum(sal) > 13000;



SQL> select ename,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by ename;

this show the duplicate records;

SQL> select empno,ename,sal,job,deptno,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by empno,ename,sal,job,deptno;

it shows the empno,ename,sal,job,deptno from emp




SQL> select empno,ename,deptno,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by empno,ename,deptno
  4  order by ename;

it show the empno,ename,deptno from emp table order by ename;


SQL> select ename,deptno,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by ename,deptno
  4  order by count(*) desc;
it shows the duplicate name in every dept


> select empno,ename,sal,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by empno,ename,sal
  4  ;
it shows the duplicate name in one table;



> select first_name,last_name,d_id
  2  from empp,department
  3  group by first_name,last_name,d_id
  4  order by count(*) desc;

it show the duplicate name in every department in two table;


it show the ename duplicate in one table based on having as well shows that whether a emp is above than 1 or not.
SQL> select ename,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by ename
  4  having count(*) > 1;



SQL> select last_name,count(*)
  2  from empp
  3  group by last_name
  4  having count(*) > 1;

it shows no row seleted, because there is no duplicate last_name in the table;



i



it shows the duplicate name in every department;

L> select ename,sal,deptno,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by ename,sal,deptno
  4  order by count(*) desc;


it shows the duplicate name in every dept that greater than one by having cluse
SQL> select ename,deptno,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  group by ename,deptno
  4  having count(*) > 1;





group by with where cluse
SQL> select ename,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  where ename LIKE 'K%'
  4  group by ename;



SQL> select ename,sal,dept.dname,count(*)
  2  from emp inner join dept
  3  on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
  4   where sal > 2000
  5  group by ename,sal,dname;
it shows the greater than 2000 sal between departments;



it shows the duplicate sal between salaries in emp table
SQL> select sal,count(*)
  2  from emp
  3  where sal > 2000
  4  group by sal
  5  order by count(*) desc;


what the group by is doing?
detail the data,
the detail give from the table.
while the detail given, the result call, summarize the data.
and summarize the data use for analysis, cuz the detail get summarize then, 
summarize data easty for analysis.

how to show that in which year how many emp joined?
it possible by to-char function
