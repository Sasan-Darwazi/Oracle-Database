Day5:
Inner join: 
whenever when you want to get data from two tables you need to join.
inner join or equal join retrieving data from the multiple/two table based on
equality condition which means it is used just ( = ).

E.G: this example will show all the records from both tables based on the inner join clause.
select c.c_name,c.c_lname,o.o_name from customer c
  2  inner join orders o
  3  on c.c_id = o.c_id;

---------------------
E.G: This example will show the record based on record names and whatever user write.
select c.c_name,c.c_lname,o.o_name from customer c
  2  inner join orders o
  3  on c.c_id = o.c_id
  4  where c.c_name = 'Ahmad'; 
-----------------------------------

E.G: This example will show the record that ordered Iphone?
select c.c_name,o.o_name from customer c
  2  inner join orders o
  3  on c.c_id = o.c_id
  4  where o.o_name = 'Iphone';
--------------------------

E.G:This example same as above example.
select c.c_name,o.o_name from customer c, orders o
where c.c_id = o.c_id and c.c_name = 'Nadir';




non-equi join: Retrieving data from multiple/two table based on
not equality condition which means it is used any condition except ( = ).
OPT which gets used ( <, >, <=, >=, !<, !>, !=, between , and),
