Relationship:The logical association among enitites called relationship.

So, we have fourth kinds of relationship:
One to One ==  Relationship in DBMS is a relationship between one instance of an entity with one insntance of another entity.

E.G: Uni vs Principle
----------------------
Many ot Many == Realtionship in DBMS is a relationship between more than one instance of an entity with more than one instance of another entity.
It means, both entity can have many relationships between each other.

E.G: Writer vs Book
----------------------
On to Many == One-to-Many relationship in DBMS is a relationship between instances of an entity with more than one instance of another entity.

E.G:Customer vs Order. a customer can have many orders.
--------------------------
Many to One: Relationship in DBMS is a relationship between more than one instances of an entity with one instance of another entity.

E.G:Project vs Student.  many project can be worked by one std.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
One to One: This is sorts of relationship which both side has One-Relation to each other.
E.G: create table uni(
uni_id number(3) primary key,
uni_name varchar2(40),
uni_location varchar2(50));
-------------------------------
create table principle(
p_id number(4) primary key,
p_name varchar2(100),
uni_id number(3),
constraint fk_uni_prin foreign key(uni_id)
references uni(uni_id);
---------------------------------------------------

Many to Many: This sorts of relation has many relation at each other.
E.G Writer vs Book

create table book(
b_id number(3) primary key,
b_name varchar2(40));

create table author(
a_id number(3) primary key,
a_name varchar2(40);

create table b_writer(
b_id number(3),
a_id number(3),
constraint fk_b_bw foreign key(b_id)
references book(b_id),
constraint fk_a_bw foreign key(a_id)
references author(a_id));
--------------------------------------------

One-to-Many: create table customer(
c_id number(3) primary key,
c_name varchar2(40));

create table orders(
o_id number(3) primary key,
o-name varchar2(40),
c-id number(3),
constraint fk_cus_ord foeign key(c_id) references customer(c_id));
----------
E.G:select * from customer,orders
where customer.c_id = orders.c_id;

E.G:select customer.c_name,o.o_name from customer,order
where customer.c_id = orders.c_id;
