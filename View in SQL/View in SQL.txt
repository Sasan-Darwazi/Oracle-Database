Views: view is a virtual/logical table for the base table.
Virtual means, the object doesn't exist physically
.view will not store data but the select query statement is only stored.
.it will be created with the help of a select statement.

Types of views:
---------
1: Simple view
2: Complex view

1: SV- when we access the required data from a single base table. then it's called Simple View.
. it can support all DML operations.
. A simple view is also called an updatable view. why updatable, it supports all the DML.



1: Simple view syntax:
create view v_name
as
select * from (where condition);

Ex: create view v1
as
select * from emp;

Testing dml in sm:
insert v1 values(1,'Name',200);
update v1 set sal = 100 where id = 1;
delete from v1 where id  = 1;

Replacing view:
create or replace view view_name
as
select deptno,ename,sal,job
from emp
group by deptno,ename,sal,job;
