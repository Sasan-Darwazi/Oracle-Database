What is Deadlock?

A deadlock occurs when two ro more transactioins are waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a circular dependency. 
As a result, none of the transactions can proceed, and the system may become unresponsive.


Note: Necessary conditions in Deadlock:

1: Hold & Wait
2: Mutual Exclusion
3: No Preemption
.Preemption: If your work is completed, then release the resources.
.non-preemption: even-though your work is completed, release the lock.
4: Circulation or circular wait.
