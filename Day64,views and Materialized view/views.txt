Views:view is virtual/logical table for the base table.
Virtual mean, the object doesnt exist physical
.view will not store data but the select query statement is only stroe.
.it will create with the help of select statement.

Types of views:
---------
1: Simple view
2: Complex view

1: SV- when we access the required data from single base table.then its called sv.
. it can support all dml operations.
. Simple view is also called updatable view.why updatabel, cuz it support all the dml.



1: Simple view syntax:
create view v_name
as
select * from (where condition);

Ex: create view v1
as
select * from emp;

Testing dml in sm:
insert v1 values(1,'Name',200);
update v1 set sal = 100 where id = 1;
delete from v1 where id  = 1;

Replacing view:
create or replace view view_name
as
select deptno,ename,sal,job
from emp
group by deptno,ename,sal,job;





2: CV- when we access the required data from multiple base tables then we call it sv.
. It doesnt supports all DML operation on mulitple base tables at a time.
. Also called as non-updatable views.
. It supports 'select' command only, but we can not perform dml operation.

.Record can be grouped. Groupd functions like, MAX,MIN,COUNT,SUM,AVG can be used.



Syntax: create view v_name
as
select * from table_name;
------------------------------------------
E.G:
First create a table:
create table mo(
id number(3),name varchar2(40),sal number(3));
---------------------
later create another table by the differ name;
---------------------
create table moo (id number(3),name varchar2(30),sal number(3));
-----------------------------------------

Now it's time to create Complex view from two table:
-----------------------
create view vw_emp 
as
select * from mo
union
select * from moo;
------
Result:it show the data from two table without duplicate data.
--------------------
create view vw_emp 
as
select * from mo
union all
select * from moo;
---------
Result: it will shows the data from two table with duplicate data.
--------------------------------------

Union OPT: it can combine all data from two table without having any duplicate.
Union All OPT: it can combine all data from two table with duplicates.
the two tables combining as a one table.

Materialized view:
is a db object that stores query output and precomputed result.

.PreCompute: to compute something in advance.
.PreCompued the standard information
.Using PreComputed tables/data


Materialized view mainly created for two reason,
1:In Databases To maintain local copy for remote database object.
2:To imporve the performence of complex group by complex aggregate operations in data warehouse,
and in data warehouses, most of queries in data warehouse perfomrm complex group by complex aggregate
operation and complex joins.

and Materialize view most used in data warehouses

SYNTAX: Create materialized view v_name
as
select statement;

EX:create materialized view vname
as
select deptno,sum(sal)
from emp
group by deptno;;


if you want to update materialized view so execute this command,
execute dbms_mview.refresh('view_name');
the updating view is called refershin view;
